Introduction
Electronic Commerce is exactly analogous to a marketplace on the internet. Electronic commerce (also referred to as EC, e-commerce) consist primarily of the distributing, buying, selling, marketing and servicing of products or services over electronic systems such as the internet and other computer networks. E-commerce follows – that is, buyers and sellers exchange and transport goods from one place to another. But rather than conducting business in the tradition way-in stores and other “brick and mortar” buildings or through mail order catalogs and telephone operators- in e-commerce buyers and sellers transact business over networked computers.
E-commerce also has some disadvantages, however. Consumers are reluctant to buy some products online. Online furniture business, for example, have failed for the most part because customers want to test the comfort of an expensive item such as a sofa before they purchase it. Consumers also need to be reassured that credit card transaction are secure and that their privacy is respected.

Tools and Technology used in this project:
Technology: 	Bootstrap, Angular JS, Spring MVC, spring  security, Hibernate, Web Flows and REST full services.
Application Server: Apache Tomcat
Database:	 H2 Database / Oracle Database.
Bootstrap:
		Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks  for developing responsive, mobile-first web sites.
	Angular Js: 
		AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. Angular's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write.
Spring MVC:
 		Spring MVC is the web component of Spring's framework. It provides a rich functionality for building robust Web Applications. The Spring MVC Framework is architected and designed in such a way that every piece of logic and functionality is highly configurable.

Spring Security:
	Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework. It is the de-facto standard for securing Spring-based applications. Spring Security is a framework that focuses on providing both authentication and authorization to Java applications.
Hibernate:
	(Hibernate in short) is an object-relational mapping framework for the Java language. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database. Hibernate solves object-relational impedance mismatch problems by replacing direct, persistent database accesses with high-level object handling functions.
Spring Web flow:
	 Spring Web Flow. Spring Web Flow. Spring Web Flow builds on Spring MVC and allows implementing the "flows" of a web application. A flow encapsulates a sequence of steps that guide a user through the execution of some business task.
Apache Tomcat:
	Apache Tomcat is an open-source web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Tomcat implements several Java EE specifications including Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Java EL, and WebSocket, and provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment for Java code to run in.
H2 Database:
	H2 is a relational database management system written in Java. It can be embedded in Java applications or run in the client-server mode. The disk footprint (size of the jar file) is about 1.5 MB.
